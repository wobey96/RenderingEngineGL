# RenderingEngineGL
My first rendering engine! RenderingEngineGL is a real time 3D rendering engine made with OpenGL. It's based on the learnopengl, Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL and C++ udemy courses. 

## Why? 
I was always mesmerized by computer graphics and had a deep desire to learn about them. It's the first thing I noticed when I was a kid playing Kingdom Hearts II (Playstation 2) and Star Fox Adventure (GameCube). This is the start of my journey to satisfy that desire :)!!!

## Demos (only has ambient lighting but diffuse lighting works)

## Updates 01/29/2024
### I won't be making any updates from here. There is still a lot I could have done like finishing the phong reflection model (specular lighting), point light, spot light, and shadows) but I wanted to start on more modern things. This was an education exercidse before I got into ray tracing and more modern graphics stuff. Thanks!
