# RenderingEngineGL
My first rendering engine! RenderingEngineGL is a real time 3D rendering engine made with OpenGL. It's based on the learnopengl, Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL and C++, and the Ray Tracing in One Weekend courses. 

## Why? 
I was always mesmerized by computer graphics and had a deep desire to learn about them. It's the first thing I noticed when I was a kid playing Kingdom Hearts II (Playstation 2) and Star Fox Adventure (GameCube). This is the start of my journey to satisfy that desire :)!!!
